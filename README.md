# Spellburn and Battlescars for FoundryVTT!

Implements basic character and item sheets for playing [Spellburn and Battlescars](https://xenio-in-a-bottle.itch.io/sab) by [Matheus Henrique Morais](https://twitter.com/Xenio_1) in Foundry VTT.
The code is based on the [Cairn system](https://github.com/yochaigal/Cairn-FoundryVTT/) for FoundryVTT (which in turn is based on the Electric Bastionland system).
